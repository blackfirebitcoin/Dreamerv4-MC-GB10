## 📖 Introduction

This repository contains the **Inference Code** for the Minecraft Autoregressive World Model.
This project serves as an **open-source reproduction of the [DreamerV4](https://danijar.com/project/dreamerv4/) architecture**, tailored specifically for high-fidelity simulation in the Minecraft environment. Our model utilizes a **MAE (Masked Autoencoder)** for efficient video compression and a **DiT (Diffusion Transformer)** architecture to autoregressively predict future game frames based on history and action inputs in the latent space.
 This codebase is streamlined for **deployment and generation**, supporting long-context inference and real-time interaction.

### Key Features
* **Inference Only**: Lightweight codebase focused on generation, stripped of complex training logic.
* **Long Context Support**: Capable of loading Long-Context models to recall events from 12 seconds prior.
* **Fast Inference Backend**: Built-in optimized inference pipeline designed for high-performance, real-time next-frame prediction.
* **Infinite Generation**: Supports infinite generation without image quality degradation during long-term rollouts.
* **Complex Interaction**: Supports a variety of interactions within the Minecraft world, such as eating food, collecting water, using weapons, etc.

## 🏰 Model Zoo

Please download the pre-trained weights and place them in the `checkpoints/` directory before running the code.
